# Blockchain Board v2

Being a lifelong skateboarder and a crypto advocate since the Mt. Gox era, I wanted to create a tangible yet functional piece of art that combined my passions.

Meet Blockchain Board!

Blockchain board is an unofficial collaboration between [@wockchain](twitter.com/wockchain) x [@303boards](https://www.instagram.com/303boards/).

The board used for this project is called "The American Dream". I thought this was perfect deck choice for a piece combining two incredibly liberating things (crypto and skateboarding).

The program itself is quite simple. Utilizing a Raspberry Pi 4 and a MAX7219 4x4 LED screen, the program polls the CoinGecko API in Node.js to display live crypto pricing on the screen.

Special shout out to [@heunetik's](https://github.com/heunetik) MAX7219 node library allowing me to interface with MAX7219 over the Raspberry Pi's SPI. [*Link Here*](https://github.com/heunetik/MAX7219-Matrix) 


Long live skateboarding, long live web3.
